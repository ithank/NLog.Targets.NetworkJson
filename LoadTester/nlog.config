        Log levels

        Each log message has associated log level, which identifies how important/detailed the message is. 
        NLog can route log messages based primarily on their logger name and log level.

        NLog supports the following log levels:

        Trace - very detailed logs, which may include high-volume information such as protocol payloads. This log level is typically only enabled during development
        Debug - debugging information, less detailed than trace, typically not enabled in production environment.
        Info - information messages, which are normally enabled in production environment
        Warn - warning messages, typically for non-critical issues, which can be recovered or which are temporary failures
        Error - error messages
        Fatal - very serious errors
